# bangalore-calliope
Calliope model, specific to a (illustrative) district in Bangalore, India.

For more information on the model structure and general use of Calliope, see [the documentation](https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

This commit provides the model for the publication:

`(Under Review) B. Pickering and R. Choudhary, ‘Out-of-Sample, Out of Mind: Quantifying Resilience in Energy Systems with Out-of-Sample Testing’, Energy, 2020`

If you use this model or work derived from it in an academic publication, please cite the above publication!

## Install

This paper ran on a release candidate of Calliope 0.6.3. To install, clone this repository, navigate into the cloned directory and create the 'calliope_DMUU' conda environment:

```shell
$ conda env create -f requirements.yml
```

## Running models

The notebook 'Building and running the model' will guide you through building the model.

## Notes

* Native Calliope plotting will not work in most cases, due to the existence of the 'scenario' dimension.
